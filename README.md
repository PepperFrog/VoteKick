When a votekick is in place player can vote for the kick of the player, if enough there is enough vote before the end of the 60 seconds the player get kicked. And there is a limit of votekick per round.

``vk start 4`` - start a votekick on the playerid 4
 
``vk list`` - list all non-admin player with their id
